In Dungeon Roller, every level is a dungeon to defeat. Roll the die before entering the dungeon to know what fate awaits for you inside. Kill all enemies and exit the dungeon in time. If you escape, you may choose to enter a new one. How many dungeons will you be able to defeat? Be careful, they only become more difficult.

Dungeon Roller is a small game made during the GMTK 2022 game jam over the course of a weekend around the theme ‘Roll of the Dice’.

Starting in 2025, I’ve been working on the game again in order to make it support multiplayers, as well as multiple languages, and expand the game systems. The idea is to make a multiplayer scalable dungeon crawler to play with as many friends as one wishes, solving puzzles and fighting bosses for progression.
